        My name is Steven Craythorn, I have been in the Army for the past 13 years and will soon be medically retiring due to some back problems. I have a beautiful wife 
      named Kayla who I have known since I was 8 years old. we dated throughout high school before splitting for about a year before refinding each other and eventually being married.
      I deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011 during Operation Enduring Freedom. While I was in theater my wife gave birth to my oldest Gwen. the math adds up to me being in one of 
      our most intense firefights when she was born. I have since had my son Ben and my daughter Adelaide.

        I began attending college in 2021 and finished my associate of science with Barton Community College in 2022 before beginning my Bachelor of Computer Science here at Southwestern. 
      I participated in the graduation ceremony in May of this year with my parents in attendance. This was a significant event in my life as I had never walked for a degree with my parents
      in attendance. I plan to go into mobile application development following some certifications and continued learning from a junior developer friend of mine. while I work on that I will be continuing
      my work as a maintenance manager. My favorite hobby by far is refinishing furniture. I tried my hand at crafting and found many of the tools needed I did not have. additionally, I love baseball.
      collecting cards and finding information is something my son and I have begun to bond over which is an exciting development.
