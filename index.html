       On this website, we will look at refinishing furniture. we will discuss projects that have been done and the process needed to be successful. We will discuss the need for the proper 
 selection of sandpaper and color palettes. As humans, we have a natural desire to be comfortable. This desire has led to many refurnishing projects that have been highly appreciated by others.
 to properly appreciate the work being done we need to view the images of others' work. at the bottom of the page is a link to a how-to page that will have a video as well as images that will 
 help to select which product is best for your project.

        I began attending college in 2021 and finished my associate of science with Barton Community College in 2022 before beginning my Bachelor of Computer Science here at Southwestern. 
      I participated in the graduation ceremony in May of this year with my parents in attendance. This was a significant event in my life as I had never walked for a degree with my parents
      in attendance. I plan to go into mobile application development following some certifications and continued learning from a junior developer friend of mine. while I work on that I will be continuing
      my work as a maintenance manager. My favorite hobby by far is refinishing furniture. I tried my hand at crafting and found many of the tools needed I did not have. additionally, I love baseball.
      collecting cards and finding information is something my son and I have begun to bond over which is an exciting development.
